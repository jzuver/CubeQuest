#What is CubeQuest:
Welcome to CubeQuest, a dungeon crawler RPG set in a deep dungeon in a far away land. You are trapped in a dungeon by the
evil CubeOrcs, and you must fight your way out using your sharp Cube egdes. Defeat the CubeOrcs who trapped you, and the 
secret monster they keep in the end of the dungeon...

2. Use the arrow keys to move around the dungeon, and move through the blue doors on each wall
3. Pick up non-moving potions using the 'e' key, and use them in battle.
4. Enemies will be on patrol and moving. Move over them, and hit 'b' to start a battle!
5. On the battle screen, you can Attack, use an Item, or Run. Select and click using the mouse.
6. Potions will heal 25 health, and can only be used in battle.
7. 'Run' will transport you out of the battle, and send you to the first room of the dungeon.
8. You will gain experience points when you fight an enemy, and you can level up to get increased health and attack power
